<p>
    The world is too much with us;
    late and soon,
    Getting and spending, we lay
    waste our powers;
    Little we see in Nature that is
    ours;
    We have given our hearts away, a
    sordid boon!
    This Sea that bares her bosom to
    the moon;
    The winds that will be howling
    at all hours,
